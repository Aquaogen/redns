Simple application to secure data on a device and across a network with applications and services that are already provided by the operating system where it is usually opt-in. I only pratice protection:

## Level of Protection
- protection, know how to dress
- pay to keep to your safe
- too powerful to keep private
- at work with or without the law

## Profile

Something like CA Technologies will cover all that is needed for anyone. 
What is covered is Scanner, Encryption, VPN, Firewall, DNS.
