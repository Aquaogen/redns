    <string name="txt_im_tip">Tip : Firewall prevents apps from accessing the Internet over Wifi or Mobile data. Since most forms of surveillance require the data to be sent over to a central repository, firewalling them effectively mitigates the threat. \n\nThere\'s a class of apps that require Internet connection all day, and those are usually communication apps like Gmail and messenger apps like WhatsApp. Firewalling them might not be an option, and that\'s why we built content blockers. </string>

        This permission is required to programmatically set DNS for your device. Think of DNS as
        an address book for the internet: It translates domains (for example, dns.google.com) to valid
        IP addresses (for example, 8.8.8.8). Setting it allows us to control out-going connections
        from any app on your device, thereby effectively preventing connections to blacklisted domains.
